# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements a Fake News Detection model using machine learning. The goal is to classify news articles as real or fake based on the dataset provided. The model uses various machine learning techniques to process the data and evaluate the accuracy of the predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q5jpI5M1EA9x3YPrLupmiu3gffkmGlHj/view?usp=sharing). It contains labeled news articles, with each article marked as either 'real' or 'fake'.

## Project Overview

- The code file `FakeNewsDetectorAI_Project.ipynb` contains the full implementation of the project.
- The project uses this dataset to train a machine learning model.
- It visualizes results through various charts, showing training accuracy, model performance, and more.
- After running the code, the model's accuracy and results will be displayed, including charts and other metrics to assess the performance of the model.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- nltk

You can install these libraries using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## How to Run

1. Download the dataset from the provided link.
2. Open the `FakeNewsDetectorAI_Project.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
3. Run the notebook cells to load the dataset, train the model, and view the results.

## Results

After running the model, the following results will be displayed:

- Model accuracy percentage.
